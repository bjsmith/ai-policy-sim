# 👨‍🔬 Talent: AI Researchers & Scientists

## United States

The United States hosts the world's largest concentration of elite AI researchers. As of 2024, [the US has over 63,000 AI researchers](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/measuring-the-us-china-ai-gap), expanded from under 50,000 in 2015. At prestigious conferences like NeurIPS 2022, [American researchers accounted for 28% of top AI researchers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/27/1090182/ai-talent-global-china-us/).

The US benefits from strong retention of international talent. [80% of AI researchers who attended graduate school in the US stayed to work in the US](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2025/01/14/ai-talent-report/), and of 100 top Chinese-origin AI researchers working at US institutions in 2019, [87 remained at US institutions by 2025](https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/12/china-ai-researchers-us-talent-pool?lang=en). However, [around half of US S&E PhDs are awarded to non-US citizens](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/written-materials/2025/01/14/ai-talent-report/), making immigration policy critical.

Competition for talent has intensified, with [China gaining ground in attracting top scientific minds](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/china/china-reverse-brain-drain-science-tech-competition-us-intl-hnk), though the US still leads in housing top AI labs.

**Model Parameters:** Starting pool of 63K AI researchers, 8% annual growth rate reflecting slower than compute/capital growth due to human capital constraints, 85% constraint factor representing immigration restrictions and competition from other sectors limiting talent availability.

## China

China has dramatically expanded its AI research workforce. From 2015 to 2024, [China's AI research workforce grew from under 10,000 to 52,000](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/measuring-the-us-china-ai-gap). In 2022, China produced [99 percent more Science & Engineering PhDs than the United States—nearly double](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/China-is-Fast-Outpacing-U.S.-STEM-PhD-Growth.pdf) (see p. 1).

Quality metrics show rapid improvement. At NeurIPS 2022, [Chinese-origin researchers accounted for 26% of top AI researchers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/27/1090182/ai-talent-global-china-us/), up from just 10% in 2019. [China is narrowing the AI talent gap as research enters the engineering phase](https://en.tmtpost.com/post/7616647), where China's manufacturing strength provides advantages.

However, retention challenges persist. [90% of those who attended graduate school in China stayed in China](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/27/1090182/ai-talent-global-china-us/amp/), but [Chinese-origin researchers continue to dominate international AI scholarship programs](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3255259/chinese-origin-researchers-stand-out-apples-2024-ai-scholarship-programme-shining-light-mainlands), indicating brain drain concerns.

**Model Parameters:** Starting pool of 52K AI researchers, 12% annual growth rate reflecting rapid PhD production and aggressive talent development programs, 75% constraint factor representing quality gaps versus elite US institutions, retention challenges, and international collaboration limitations.
